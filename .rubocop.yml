# This cop catches methods that assigns many variables, even if the complexity
# is low and readability is high.
Metrics/AbcSize:
  Enabled: false

# Short lines are in general good for readability but splitting up one
# expression into multiple lines can be less readable. Aim for 80 chars but
# allow 120.
Metrics/LineLength:
  Max: 120

# Aim for 10 lines and less in each methods but accept slightly longer ones.
Metrics/MethodLength:
  Max: 20

Layout/IndentArray:
  EnforcedStyle: consistent

# Use wrapping empty lines in modules containing methods (the first and last
# method should have the same spacing to the module as there are between
# methods).
#
# Don't however use wrapping empty lines for a module that merely wraps another
# module.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundModuleBody:
  Enabled: false

# A module that merely wraps one single direct child module should not be
# indented. Every other code block must be indented.
Layout/IndentationWidth:
  IgnoredPatterns:
    - '^\s*module'

Style/Documentation:
  Enabled: false

# Single quotes being faster is hardly measurable and only affects parse time.
# Enforcing double quotes reduces the times where you need to change them
# when introducing an interpolation. Use single quotes only if their semantics
# are needed.
Style/StringLiterals:
  EnforcedStyle: double_quotes

# Conflict too often with Metric/LineLength.
